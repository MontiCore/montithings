# MontiThings Tool
The MontiThings tool is an all-in-one solution and makes running MontiThings
just as easy as writing `montithings run componentname`. 

## Installing
1. Place the `montithings` file in this project in a folder in your home folder 
   called `.montithings`. 
2. Build the CLI using `mvn clean install`
3. Place the generated JAR (named similar to `cli-7.0.0-SNAPSHOT-cli.jar`) 
   in your home folder in a folder called `.montithings/jar` (or any other folder 
   anywhere you like)
4. Add the `.montithings` folder to your `PATH`. 

## Usage

```
usage: montithings [run [local]|logs [-f]|stop] component
  run           build and execute component
  run local     build and execute component as distributed application
  logs          show the logs of component instance (cat)
  logs -f       show the logs of component instance (tail -f)
  stop          stop the execution of component (only for distributed)
```

## Example

Try it out with the application under `applications/mqtt-ports`

1. Run the project `montithings run hierarchy.Example`. 
   The tool will generate code, compile it, and start the application.
   Stop it by pressing CTRL+C.
2. Run the project as a distributed application `montithings run local hierarchy.Example`.
   The tool will generate code, compile it, and start the application in background.
3. To inspect the logs of the `hierarchy.Example.sink` component, call `montithings logs -f hierarchy.Example.sink`.
   Stop watching the logs by pressing CTRL+C. 
4. To stop the backgrounded application, call `montithings stop`.

# MontiThings CLI

The MontiThings CLI can be used to validate, pretty-print, 
and generate code from models.
It can be used without any build scripts.
For projects with a longer lifespan, we recommend considering 
the build process with Maven or Gradle.

                                    should be separated by spaces and will be
