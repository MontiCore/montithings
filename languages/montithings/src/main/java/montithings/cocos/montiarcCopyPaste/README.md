CoCos in this directory are copy-paste from MontiArc.

MontiArc hardcoded ArcTypeCheck in CoCos. 
The ArcTypeCheck can't handle SI Units.
The cocos in this folder replace ArcTypeCheck with MontiThingsTypeCheck.
Everything else is plain copy paste.

TODO: Remove this folder once MontiArc fixed this.
