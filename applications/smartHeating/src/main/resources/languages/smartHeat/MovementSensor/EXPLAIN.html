    <h1>Movement Sensor</h1>
        <p>This component defines under which circumstances the signal of a movement sensor should activate an action for a thermostat.</p>
        
        
        <h3>Example Model</h3>
        <p>Activate 2 for 2 hours if threshold 0.6 is exceeded on sensor 2</p>
        <p>Activate 1 for 5 hours if threshold 0.2 is exceeded on sensor 1</p>


        <h3>Model Format Rules</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Every line defines one relation between sensor and thermostat. "Activate 2 for 2 hours if threshold 0.6 is exceeded on sensor 2" means that, the thermostat 2 is activated for 2 hours after the sensor 2 has an output greater that 0.6.</li>
            </ul>
