        This project is a simple example for the end user development feature for MontiThings.

        It consists of 4 Components:
        <ul>
            <li>"Machine", which is the parent component.</li>
            <li>"numGen", which outputs a number that constantly counts up. This component also receives the final result and logs it.</li>
            <li>"calc", which is a component that can receive an end-user model and does some math on the incoming variable, based on this uploaded model.</li>
            <li>"print", which is a component that can receive an end-user model and creates different strings dependent on the in the model specified parameters.</li>
        </ul>
