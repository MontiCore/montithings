# Note

The content of this package is copy-pasted from montithings.
The reason for this bad practice is not to depend on `montithings.generator.cd2cpp`.
A cleaner solution would probably be to move the helper classes somewhere upwards into some class diagram related package (e.g. `de.monticore.lang.cd4analysis`).
