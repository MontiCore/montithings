# Generators

The code generators in this folder are the tools
for converting models into other text, like C++ code.

## montithings2cpp

This is MontiThings' main generator.
It converts MontiThings models and other artifacts into complete
C++ projects.
If you're thinking about adding new functionalities to the
generated code, this is probably the place you want to look at first.

## cd2cpp

This generator converts
[CD4A class diagrams](https://github.com/MontiCore/cd4analysis)
into C++ code.
The resulting code is used by code generated by the
`montithings2cpp` generator as data types.

## cd2proto

MontiThings can exchange data with projects written in other languages
like Python using [Google Protobuf](https://protobuf.dev).
MontiThings describes its data structures using class diagrams.
This generator converts class diagrams into `.proto` files to provide
compatibility with Google Protobuf.

## SD4ComponentTesting

The `SD4ComponentTesting` sub-project creates C++ test cases from
sequence diagrams.
It is located not here but under [`tools/sd4componenttesting`](../tools/sd4componenttesting) because
it contains both a language and a generator.
