# DDS Data Type Definition
DDS follow a data-centric principle. 
Exchanged messages of MT components are typed as defined in `DDSLogTracerMessage.idl`.
Corresponding .h and .cpp files are generated by OpenDDS.
Thus, if changes are made in `DDSLogTracerMessage.idl`, all other file have to be generated again.
Please refer to instructions explained [here](../../../../dds/message-types/README.md)
