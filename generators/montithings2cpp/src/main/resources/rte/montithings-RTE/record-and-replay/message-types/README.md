# DDS Data Type Definition
DDS follow a data-centric principle. 
Exchanged messages of MT components are typed as defined in `DDSRecorderMessage.idl`.
Corresponding .h and .cpp files are generated by OpenDDS.
Thus, if changes are made in `DDSRecorderMessage.idl`, all other file have to be generated again.

There are two methods to generate C++ type supporting files:

1. Manually generate files. Make sure that OpenDDS is sourced: `source OpenDDS/setenv.sh`. 
Then execute 

- `tao_idl --idl-version 4 DDSRecorderMessage.idl`,
- `opendds_idl DDSRecorderMessage.idl`,
- `tao_idl --idl-version 4 DDSRecorderMessageTypeSupport.idl`, and

There might be an issue executing the last two commands.
Unfortunately there is no fix known yet, which is why the second method is preferred.

1. Temporarily add the following to the CMakeLists and copy files from the build directory:
- `OPENDDS_TARGET_SOURCES(MontiThingsRTE "dds/message-types/DDSRecorderMessage.idl")`
